🐍 A long long time ago, I started with Python 1.5 at *web.de*,
founded the *MoinMoin* wiki project shortly thereafter, and am now
enjoying the increased traction that Python recently gets from
data science and machine learning.




I am a data scientist and bioinformatician by training. 
My research interest includes bioinformatics, AI for drug discovery, precision medicine, computer vision applications of Deep Learning and model interpretability.
